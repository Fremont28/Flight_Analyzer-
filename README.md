Scraping and analyzing flight patterns

With increasing flight connections to the United States and Europe, South American based flights are often faced with departure delays. [1] Although South American flights are no more likely to be delayed than other flights across the world, we think that it will be interesting to analyze the flight delay trends and patterns on flights departing from this continent. [2]

The side benefit of more incoming flights is the convenience of taking direct flights to exotic places. For instance, Santiago residents can fly to and from Melbourne and Sydney just in case they want to catch waves on the other side of the world. Ecuadoreans now go direct to Amsterdam (from Quito).

To measure South American flight delays, we calculated the average delay time for departing South American flights (scheduled departure time – actual departure time) ranging from Buenos Aires to Mexico City from mid-afternoon Wednesday, February 13th through early Friday morning February 15th local time.
